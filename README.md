# MGT 645 Project

This is the starter project for MGT 645. You'll fork this
code in order to get started with your project. 

## Getting started

For the following instructions, we assume that you are logged
into the virtual machine you are using for MGT 645. 

To clone the repository, issue you'll use the following git command.

	git clone https://git.yale.edu/klj39/mgt656-project.git

To do that, you'll need to be on the Yale network, or on the Yale VPN.
Then, you can do 

	cd mgt656-project

Then, you'll need to install the dependencies

	npm install

And, finally, you can run the code

	nodemon app.js

That will run the [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)
program, which is a nice way of running node and then restarting
it when your files change.
